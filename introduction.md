# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. AI can be broadly categorized into two types: Narrow AI and General AI.

## Narrow AI vs. General AI

   - Examples include recommendation systems, voice assistants like Siri and Alexa, and self-driving cars.
   - Limited to the predefined functions it was created for.

2. **General AI (Strong AI)**:
   - Theoretical concept.
   - Possesses the ability to perform any intellectual task that a human can.
   - Not yet achieved; would require significant advancements in machine learning and cognitive computing.

## Key Components of AI

1. **Machine Learning (ML)**:
   - A subset of AI focused on building systems that learn from data.The ability of machine to learn from data . To go beyond its initial programming .
   - Algorithms detect patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.
   - Types of ML:
     - **Supervised Learning**: Trained on labeled data (e.g., spam detection).Classification , Regression
     - **Unsupervised Learning**: Works on unlabeled data to find hidden patterns (e.g., customer segmentation). Clustering
     - **Reinforcement Learning**: Learns by interacting with an environment to achieve a goal (e.g., game playing).
